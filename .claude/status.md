# Project Status — arl_app

**Last updated:** 2026-05-12
**Current phase:** Implement
**Progress:** Flutter Feature Audit fixes — Priority 1–3 of 5 complete (SecurityScreen, BiometricScreen, InitialSetupScreen).

## Summary
Flutter port of `Growize App Design.html` (17 pages). Core screens scaffolded across 12 features. Active work: HTML-parity fixes — global header/logo, font bundling, back-nav stack behavior.

## Completed Phases
- Ideate (design source-of-truth identified)
- Plan (HTML parity audit — see decisions/2026-04-24_html-parity-gap.md)

## Current Phase Details
- HTML-parity fixes: logo asset wiring, pubspec assets/fonts declaration, global sticky header, back-button stack restoration.
- Defensive back buttons added on support/project_detail screens (Apr 24).
- SecurityScreen rewritten to persist toggles + app-PIN (hashed client-side) + real login history; migration 026 applied via `supabase db query --linked` (see decisions/2026-05-12_security-screen-persistence.md).
- BiometricScreen registered as `/biometric`; used as enrollment gate from SecurityScreen Biometric Login toggle (see decisions/2026-05-12_biometric-screen-wiring.md).
- InitialSetupScreen now validates + persists KYC to `investors` (RLS scoped to own row); migration 027 applied (see decisions/2026-05-12_initial-setup-persistence.md).
- Ops doc inventory done — recommend appending SecurityScreen/BiometricScreen behaviour notes to `docs/ops_admin_guide.md` (canonical 1070-line ops doc); pending user decision.

## Blockers
- None.
