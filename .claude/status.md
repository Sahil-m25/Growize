# Project Status — arl_app

**Last updated:** 2026-05-12
**Current phase:** Implement
**Progress:** Flutter Feature Audit fixes — Priority 1 + 2 of 5 complete (SecurityScreen, BiometricScreen).

## Summary
Flutter port of `Growize App Design.html` (17 pages). Core screens scaffolded across 12 features. Active work: HTML-parity fixes — global header/logo, font bundling, back-nav stack behavior.

## Completed Phases
- Ideate (design source-of-truth identified)
- Plan (HTML parity audit — see decisions/2026-04-24_html-parity-gap.md)

## Current Phase Details
- HTML-parity fixes: logo asset wiring, pubspec assets/fonts declaration, global sticky header, back-button stack restoration.
- Defensive back buttons added on support/project_detail screens (Apr 24).
- SecurityScreen rewritten to persist toggles + app-PIN (hashed client-side) + real login history; migration 026 applied via `supabase db query --linked` (see decisions/2026-05-12_security-screen-persistence.md).
- BiometricScreen registered as `/biometric`; used as enrollment gate from SecurityScreen Biometric Login toggle (see decisions/2026-05-12_biometric-screen-wiring.md).

## Blockers
- No git repo at project root — `git init` needed before logical-commit boundaries can be enforced.
